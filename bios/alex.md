### Alexander Kremser

I am an interaction designer currently working on improving educational technology. As I am the one editing this webpage I granted myself the privilege of addressing you directly.

One of my major goals is creating tools that enable and aid human expression, in order to shift each others perspective, gaining insight.

I fight for digital independence and believe that the ideals and ways of thinking of open-source culture will lead us to a better future. 

If you share my ideals and also want to create empowering, free creative software, don’t hesitate to contact me.
