### Alexander Kremser

I am an interaction designer currently working on improving educational technology; I’m addressing you directly because I am the one editing this webpage.

One of my major goals is creating tools that enable and aid human expression, in order to shift each others perspective, gaining insight.

I fight for digital independence and believe that the ideals and ways of thinking of open-source culture will lead us to a better future. 

If you share my ideals and also want to create empowering, free creative software, don’t hesitate to contact me.
